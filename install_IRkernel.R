# As Nov 5, 2919, installation problem is encountered in the last line "IRkernel::installspec()"
# I guess it is because "jupyter" is not in the path
# Solution:
# In 'anaconda prompt', cd to the location of R.exe and run ".\R" to enter R command line interface
# Run "IRkernel::installspec()" inside and then quit. It solves the problem
