    "\n",
    "One cannot acquire a new programming language without investing numerous hours.\n",
    "[R-Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) is an official manual\n",
    "maintained by the R core team.\n",
    "It was the first document that I perused painstakingly when I began to learn R in 2005.\n",

    "The help system is the first thing we must learn for a new language.\n",
    "In R, if we know the exact name of a function and want to check its usage, we can either call `help(function_name)` or a single question mark `?function_name`.\n",
    "If we do not know the exact function name, we can instead use the double question mark `??key_words`. It will provide a list of related function names from a fuzzy search.\n",

    "Unlike C, R does not require explicit type declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    " `<-` assigns the value on its right-hand side to a self-defined variable name on its left-hand side. `=` is an alternative for assignment, which I prefer.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `*` and `\\` are performed element by element.\n",
    "So are the binary logical operations `&` `|` `!=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Factor* is a categorical number. *Character* is text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in R is represented as `NA` (Not Available). When some operations are not allowed, say, `log(-1)`, R returns  `NaN` (Not a Number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector selection is specified in square bracket `a[ ]` by either positive integer or logical vector.\n",
