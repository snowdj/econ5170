    "Probability theory has an infamous inception for its association with gambling.\n",
    "Monte Carlo, the European casino capital, is another unfortunate presence.\n",
    "However, naming it Macau simulation or Hong Kong Jockey Club simulation does not make me feel any better.\n",
    "I decide to simply call it \"simulation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation has been widely used for (i) checking finite-sample performance of asymptotic theory; (ii) bootstrap, an automated inference procedure;\n",
    "(iii) generating non-standard distributions; (iv) approximating integrals with no analytic expressions. In this lecture, we will focus on (i) and (ii), whereas (iii) and (iv)\n",
    "will be deferred to the next lecture on integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we will start to write script. A script is a piece of code for a particular\n",
    "purpose. We do not write a script of thousands of lines from the beginning\n",
    "to the end; we develop it recursively. We cut a big job into small manageable tasks.\n",
    "Write a small piece, test it, and perhaps encapsulate it into a user-defined function.\n",
    "Small pieces are integrated by the super structure. This is just like building an Airbus 380.\n",
    "The engines and wings are made in UK, the fuselage is made in Germany and so on.\n",
    "All pieces are assembled in Toulouse, France, and then the giant steel bird can fly.\n",

    "He used a deterministic approximation algorithm.\n",

    "we have full control of the data generation process, so we also know the\n",
    "true parameter.\n",
    "In a real example, however, we have no knowledge about the true model, so we cannot directly\n",
    "evaluate the quality of parameter estimation.\n",
    "\n",
